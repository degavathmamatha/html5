    <P style="background-color: #ff00d4;">Kathak :

        Kathak is one of the eight classical dances of our country
        Kathak is believed to have originated from the Nomadic Bards of Northern India (Kathakars)
        Kathak is a dance that involves story telling through the dance (Katha Means Story)
        The dance includes both mime and dance alternatively
        Kathak dance Kathak is one of the major classical dances of India. Kathak originated from Northern India through a group of Nomadic Bards. Katha means “Story telling” and Kathak means “art of story telling”. So Kathak is a dance that tells a story through alternative passages of mime and dance. Kathak dance is more or less similar to the classical dance Bharatnatyam. Kathak is generally performed with the dancer standing straight legged. Dancers wear ankles which sound according to the movements of the legs. This makes the dance more enchanting and musical to the ears because Kathak emphasizes more on footwork.
         Kathak is a dance that was practised both men and women and till this day it’s the same way.</P>
